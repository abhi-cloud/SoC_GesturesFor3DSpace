## Practice / Implementation of OpenCV (using python)

As of now, I have learned the following methods/techniques in OpenCV (still learning):
1. Basic reading/writing of images/videos in different colorScales.
2. Adding geometric shapes in images/videos (both are the same thing).
3. Handling mouse events.
4. Functions available for handling of images(get/set methods).
5. Bitwise operations
6. Adding trackbars for adjusting various properties.
7. Object detection using HSV ColorSpace in images, therefore in videos too.
8. Simple/Adaptive Thresholding
9. Basics of Matplotlib
10. Morphological Transformations
11. Smoothing/Blurring of images
12. Edge Detection using Image Gradient methods
13. Canny Edge Detection
14. Image Pyramids
15. Image Blending using Pyramids
16. Finding and drawing contours on images
17. Motion Detection using contours
18. Basics of Image Histograms
19. Template Matching
20. Hough Transform for enge detection
21. Face Detecton using Haar Cascade Classifiers
22. Corner Detection using Harris Corner Detector and Shi Tomasi Detector

I am learning OpenCV from this YouTube channel called "Programming Language" and it's AMAAZING!!!

All the implementation python files are in this repo. I have also created a folder which contains some photos/videos of implementation.

P.S. The I haven't used Jupyter notebooks for OpenCV practice, as I started it before the mentee selection and had no information before about using it. For other libraries I will be using Jupyter Notebooks.
