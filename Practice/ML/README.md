# Practicing and learning ML

I’m learning ML from a book called **“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow”** by **“Aurélien Géron”**.<br>
The book’s implementations can be found
<a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2">here</a>.<br>
My learnings and implementation are in this repo folder.

I'm done with the following chapters-
1. The Machine Learning Landscape
2. End-to-End Machine Learning Project
3. Classification
4. Training Models
