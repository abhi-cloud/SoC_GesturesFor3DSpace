# Practicing and learning ML

I’m learning ML from a book referred by the mentors called *“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow”* by *“Aurélien Géron”*.<br>
The book’s implementations can be found
<a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2">here</a>
My learnings and implementation are in this repo.
