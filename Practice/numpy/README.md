## Practice / Implementation of NumPy

As of now, I have learned the following methods/techniques in NumPy (still learning):
1. The Basics of NumPy Arrays
2. Computation on NumPy Arrays: Universal Functions
3. Comparisons, Masks, and Boolean Logic
4. Sorting Arrays
5. Fancy Indexing
6. Structured Data using NumPy arrays

I am learning the library from a book called <b>"Python Data Science Handbook</b> by <b>"Jake VanderPlas"</b>
Now I refer to the documentation for more detailing.<br>
Check out the book

All the implementation python, jupyter notebook and the data files are in this repo.
