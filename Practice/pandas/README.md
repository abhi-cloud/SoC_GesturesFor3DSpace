## Practice / Implementation of Pandas

As of now, I have learned the following methods/techniques in Pandas (still learning):
1. The Basics of pandas
2. Pandas Objects
3. Indexing in pandas
4. Fancy Indexing
5. Structured Data using Pandas arrays

Many of the features of pandas are derived from numpy, I'm not repeating them here, all of that has already been uploaded in the numpy directory of this repo.<br>

I am learning the library from a book called <b>"Python Data Science Handbook</b> by <b>"Jake VanderPlas"</b>
Now I refer to the documentation for more detailing.<br>
Check out the book
<a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html">here</a>

All the implementation python, jupyter notebook and the data files are in this repo.
